# Small calculator
Small project that parses a string, containing \n-delimited statements. Each statement starts by a variable name, which is followed by an equal sign, and then an equation that should be computed according to the right priority of operations.
## Expected input format
Expected format for the input (returned by `get_input()`) should be an UTF8-encoded equation with numbers, variable identifiers as well as operations between those numbers and variables.
